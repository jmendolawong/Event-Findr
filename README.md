## Summary
Event Findr enables a simple user interface integrated to the TicketMaster API. A user can search by specific city or zip code and specificy the number of results to return. Results will render asynchronously with the date of the event and a link to buy tickets. If any of the returned results fall on the day that the user is searching for, weather will pop up for the area determined by the user. This is generated from the apixu weather API. If no events fall on the same day as the search, no weather will appear.
